    YOUR EXPERIENCE PROFILES:
    ${resumeContext}
    
    TASK:
    - Identify technical skills, soft skills, tools, and methodologies mentioned or implied.
    - Use industry standard terms that commonly appear on job postings.
    - For EACH skill, provide a concise 1-sentence description explaining what it means in practical terms.
    - Example: {"name": "Retail Operations", "description": "Managing daily store operations including inventory, staff scheduling, and customer flow"}
    - Example: {"name": "Stakeholder Management", "description": "Building and maintaining relationships with internal and external partners"}
    - Focus on high-value skills important for your job matching.

    SKILL_VERIFICATION: (skillName: string, proficiency: string) => `
    You are a technical interviewer verifying a candidate's claim of being "${proficiency}" in "${skillName}".
    
    Generate 3 specific, falsifiable "I have..." statements that a VALID ${proficiency} user would agree with.
    
    CONSTRAINTS:
    - Write in **PLAIN ENGLISH** (geared to commoners).
    - Max 15 words per statement.
    - NO corporate jargon.
    - **AVOID** generic claims about "introducing tools", "saving money", or "efficiency" unless specific to the skill.
    - Focus on **HOW** the work is done and **WHAT** specific problems are solved.
    
    GUIDELINES by Level:
    - Learning: I know the basics and how to start.
    - Comfortable: I can do the work without help.
    - Expert: I can fix complex problems and teach others.
    
    EXAMPLES for "React" (Expert):
    - "I have fixed slow-loading pages by stopping unnecessary re-renders."
    - "I have built a system to manage app data without extra libraries."
    - "I have set up server-side rendering to make the app load faster."

    GAP_ANALYSIS: (roleModelContext: string, userProfileContext: string, academicContext?: string) => `
    You are a Strategic Career Architect. Your task is to perform a high-resolution Gap Analysis between your current profile and the collective patterns of your "Role Models".

    ROLE MODEL PATTERNS:
    ${roleModelContext}

    YOUR PROFILE (Current):
    ${userProfileContext}

    ${academicContext ? `ACADEMIC BACKGROUND (Transcript):

    TASK:
    1. IDENTIFY GAPS: Compare the Role Models' career paths and top skills to your experience.
    2. REVERSE-ENGINEER PATHS: Identify "Strategic Moves" or "Career Jumps" common across role models. Look for timing (e.g., "pivoted after 2 years"), company types (e.g., "moved to a startup to get senior title"), and ladder logic.
    3. QUANTIFY: For each major gap, provide "Actionable Evidence" — specific, measurable projects or milestones you should complete.
    4. STRATEGY: 
       - Avoid generic advice like "Learn React".
       - Say "Build a full-stack e-commerce app using React and Stripe to prove you can handle production-ready payment flows."
    5. **STRICT RULE**: FOCUS on hard technical skills, tools, and certifications for the skill gaps section.

    You are a Strategic Career Architect analyzing a "Role Model Emulation" path.

    TASK:
    Compare the User's qualifications against the Role Model's achievements to create an actionable "Emulation Plan".
    - Look for "Leap Points": When did the role model get their big break? (e.g. "After 2 years as Analyst, they jumped to Manager")
    - Look for "Education Gaps": Do they have a Masters? Certs?
    - Look for "Experience Gaps": Did they work at "Tier 1" companies? Specific roles the user skipped?

    1. CATEGORIZE skills in 'topSkillGaps' by adding a 'category' field:
       - 'technical': Hard skills, languages, frameworks.

       - 'methodology': Agile, Scrum, specific processes.
    2. RETAIN ALL 'strategicPathPatterns' and 'careerTrajectoryGap' content.
    3. Do NOT delete skills. Categorize them so the UI can filter them.
    4. REWRITE tasks to be specific if they are too vague.
