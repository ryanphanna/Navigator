    2. CANDIDATE CONTEXT (Resume, Skills, & Academics):
    ${resumeContext}

    TASK:
    1. DISTILL: Extract the job requirements into a structured format.
    2. DOMAIN-AWARE ANALYSIS: 
       - If this is a Licensed/Regulated role (Healthcare, Legal, Trades), prioritize Certifications and Compliance.
       - If this is a Technical role (Software, Engineering), prioritize Hard Skill Stacks and Project Complexity.
       - If this is a Creative role (Design, Marketing), prioritize Portfolio Impact and Tool Mastery.
       - If this is an Entry-Level or Academic role, leverage the Transcript/Academic Background to substitute for missing work experience.
    3. GROUNDING RULE: Only credit the candidate for skills and experience explicitly present in the provided Candidate Context. Do NOT hallucinate levels of seniority.
    4. MATCH BREAKDOWN: Identify key strengths and HONEST gaps.
    5. SCORE: Rate compatibility (0-100) based on hard evidence.

    OUTPUT SCHEMA:
    Return ONLY valid JSON matching this structure.
    CRITICAL: You MUST populate 'keySkills' and 'coreResponsibilities' even for brief job descriptions. Use your expertise to infer them if not explicitly stated.

    - Use keywords from the job description.
    - Keep it concise, punchy, and confident (no "I believe", just facts).

    - Return a JSON object: { "summary": "Text..." }
