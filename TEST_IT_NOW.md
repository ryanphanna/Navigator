# ✅ Test It Right Now!

You already have GitHub Copilot installed? Great! Just 2 quick steps:

## Step 1: Pull the Changes
```bash
git pull
```

This gets the new `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file that teaches Copilot about JobFit.

## Step 2: Reload VS Code
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
- Type "Reload Window"
- Press Enter

This makes VS Code load the new configuration.

## Step 3: Test It!

Open Copilot Chat:
- Click the chat icon 💬 in the left sidebar
- Or press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or `Cmd+Shift+I` on Mac)

Then ask:
```
"What are the main features of this JobFit application?"
```

If it gives you a **detailed, specific answer** about job analysis, resume blocks, cover letters, etc. → **IT WORKS!** 🎉

If it still says it can't see your code → Make sure you:
1. Actually pulled the latest changes (`git pull`)
2. Reloaded the window
3. Opened VS Code in the `/JobFit` folder (not a parent folder)
