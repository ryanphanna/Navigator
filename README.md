# Navigator

A premium, AI-powered career co-pilot to analyze job compatibility, bridge skill gaps, and optimize your academic journey using Google Gemini.

## Problem

The modern career path is fragmented. Job seekers juggle siloed resumes, navigate opaque job boards, and manually assess skills—all without a cohesive strategy. It's time-consuming and inefficient. Navigator bridges this gap by turning your professional experience into a modular, intelligence-driven asset.

## Features

- Match & Analysis • Instant compatibility scoring, gap analysis, and icon emulation.
- Modular Resume • AI-tailored "blocks" for hyper-personalized, instant applications.
- Strategic Roadmaps • Automated 12-month career pathing and academic benchmarking.
- Smart Capture • Single-click job saving and AI-powered inbox triage.

## The Stack

- **AI** • Google Gemini (Flash & Pro)
- **Frontend** • React 19 • Vite • Tailwind CSS • Framer Motion
- **Backend** • Supabase + Vercel
- **Commerce** • Stripe
